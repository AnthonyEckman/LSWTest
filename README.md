Structure
    The scene allows the player to walk around the shop, buy items from countertops and sell items from their inventory to the shopkeeper. Player can open their inventory and equip armour to their character. To Exit the scene players can click the exit button in the top left part of the screen.
    There are two main managers that run the scene, InventoryManager and the UIManager.The inventory manager handles all player inventory interactions and the UIManager does most of the heavy lifting and controls what ui elements are shown.

Overview
    When starting this project, my overall goal was to focus primarily on UX design for a smooth shop experience. I didnâ€™t want to create a generic shop menu that pops up and you can trade items back and forth, so I created a system that allows the player to look at items displayed in the store and buy them directly off the counters. Selling still goes through the shopkeeper, but gives the player more of a reason to walk and explore the shop. Since most of my experience as a dev is as a 3d-tech artists, working in 2D was pretty different and was initially a little jarring when starting the project. I created most assets by hand except the item icons, but I wish i had a little more time to design a more pleasing looking shop.
    For my performance I think I did an alright job, although my classes and formatting became a bit missy towards the final stretch. Main focus was to make sure there were no bugs, responsive UI, and accountability for edge use cases. Some shortcoming of the scene are that you cant reclaim sold items and the shops inventory does not refresh in any way. If given another day i would of focused more on some more visual and audio feedback to make the scene come to life.
